# Current state

Operational handoff. This is not a history log.

## Repository

- Identity: `mangust5580/GoodCall`
- Default branch: `main`
- Current branch: `main`
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages project site (`/GoodCall/`)

## Current milestone

**Components — open.** Implemented slice: **Components A — Core Controls & Forms**,
covering raster sections 02 Buttons & Controls and 03 Inputs & Forms.

Components A is **awaiting user visual PASS**. Raster sections 01 and 04-08 are
not implemented.

**Foundations — complete.**

**User visual PASS received for Foundations / Colors on 2026-08-19.** The
approval came from the user; no agent self-certified it.

Closure is bounded to the evidence `Foundations.png` actually contains. That
raster is a colour scheme sheet, so the accepted design-backed scope is the
colour system: primitive, alpha and semantic/role colour tokens, gradients,
colour-only state and focus roles, global semantic colour application, and the
temporary Foundations reference surface.

Categories the raster never specified are listed under Deferred Foundations
evidence. None were invented, and none block this closure.

## Publish status

- Active branch: `main`, pushed to `origin`.
- **GitHub CI: active and green.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs install →
  typecheck → lint → lint:styles → format:check → build on push and pull request
  to `main`.
- **GitHub Pages deployment: active and green.** Pages is configured with
  `build_type: workflow`, publishing from `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Published site: <https://mangust5580.github.io/GoodCall/>

## Task handoff output

Every bounded Claude Code or Codex task finishes by fully overwriting
repository-root `AUDIT.md` with its final result — implementation, publish,
maintenance, review and correction tasks included, and blocked or failed tasks
too. It is the current attachable handoff, never appended to and never
committed; `/AUDIT.md` is gitignored.

Independent audits themselves remain optional. See the AUDIT.md section of
`AGENTS.md`.

## Implemented layers

- React + TypeScript + Vite SPA baseline.
- Entry point: `src/main.tsx`.
- Application ownership: `src/app/`.
- Global styling entry: `src/styles/global.scss` — applies page surface, primary
  text and link roles.
- Foundations colour tokens: `src/styles/foundations/` (`_colors.scss`,
  `_gradients.scss`, `_index.scss`).
- Generic SCSS helpers: `src/styles/helpers/` (fluid scalars, media mixins,
  `emit-vars`).
- Generic UI SVG icon assets for Components A controls/forms:
  `src/assets/icons/`.
- Foundations colour reference surface: `src/app/FoundationsColorReference.tsx`
  with its own reference-only styles.
- Temporary reference pages: `src/app/TemporaryReference.tsx`.
- Reusable controls and form fields: `src/components/ui/`, with the shared
  control system in `controls.scss`.
- Components A reference surface: `src/app/ComponentsReference.tsx`.

There is no router, no data layer, and no feature architecture. The reference
surfaces are development comparison pages, not product UI.

### Components A

`src/components/ui/` provides Button, Tabs, Chip, Toggle, Checkbox, Radio,
QuantityStepper, Pagination, TextField, SearchField, SelectField, TextareaField,
PhoneField, DateField, RangeSlider and Icon, exported through `index.ts`.

The shared control system lives in `controls.scss` as `--control-*` custom
properties: one control height, three radii, one border and focus treatment, one
padding and one icon size. It is owned by Components, not Foundations, and is
deliberately not a general spacing, radius or type scale.

Icons are the eight prepared SVGs in `src/assets/icons/`, applied as CSS masks so
they inherit `currentColor`. The SVG paths are never duplicated into TypeScript.

The Components reference surface composes the real components; it does not
reimplement look-alike markup.

### Colour tokens

86 CSS custom properties are emitted on `:root` from Sass maps, which are the
single source of truth:

- 33 primitives — base, status, Brand Purple 50-900, Accent Violet 100-700,
  Neutral Gray 50-900 (`--color-*`)
- 15 alpha steps — white, black, purple (`--alpha-*`)
- 32 semantic roles — text, surface, border, state, overlay, backdrop
  (`--role-*`)
- 6 gradients (`--gradient-*`)

Eight semantic roles carry literal values because the raster specifies colours
absent from every primitive ramp: Card Soft, Brand Soft, Hero, Border Soft,
Success Soft, Warning Soft, Danger Soft, Info Soft. They are intentionally not
aliases and no fake primitive steps were added for them.

Overlay and Backdrop define a base colour only. The raster states no opacity and
no difference between them, so composition is deferred.

### px-first authoring, rem on output

SCSS source authors lengths in `px` and never hand-writes `rem`. Stylelint's
`unit-disallowed-list` rejects `rem` in source. `postcss.config.js` is the single
conversion point.

- Root basis: 16px, `replace: true`.
- `minPixelValue: 2` — intentional 1px hairlines stay 1px.
- `mediaQuery: false` — authored px breakpoints stay px in compiled CSS.
- Only `px` is matched, so `%`, viewport, container units, `fr`, angles, time and
  unitless values pass through untouched.

Verified in build output: `24px → 1.5rem`, `18px → 1.125rem`, `1px solid`
unchanged, `50%` / `100dvh` unchanged, `@media (width >= 768px)` unchanged.

### SCSS helpers

`src/styles/helpers/` holds the generic helper layer, consumed through its entry
point (`@use '../helpers' as h;`). It contains no design tokens — Foundations
owns those.

- `h.fluid($desktop, $mobile)` and `h.fluid-between($desktop, $mobile, $from, $to)`
  take **unitless px numbers**: `h.fluid(18, 14)`. Unit-bearing input is a
  compile-time error. They emit a bounded `clamp()` whose px terms the PostCSS
  boundary converts to rem, leaving the `vw` term relative.
- Default fluid viewport range: 320 → 1280.
- `h.media-up`, `h.media-max`, `h.media-range` take a px length (`768px`).
  Named breakpoints are deferred until Foundations defines them.

### Base path

`vite.config.ts` holds the only copy of the `/GoodCall/` base path. Application
code reads `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. A future router derives its basename from
that same value.

## Temporary reference pages

The base page no longer hosts the Foundations surface. A query-string check in
`App.tsx` selects the surface, with no router and no new dependency:

- base URL — temporary reference index, linking to the two surfaces below
- `?reference=foundations` — the Foundations colour reference
- `?reference=components` — the Components A reference surface

Links are built from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so they resolve under the
GitHub Pages base without hardcoding the repository name, and no SPA fallback is
needed because the path never changes.

These are temporary development surfaces, not production routes, and will be
removed when the reference surfaces are no longer needed.

## Design reconciliation

Raster evidence defines visual intent and component coverage; accepted
Foundations and established system rules win over incidental raster differences.
Near-duplicate specimen differences are normalized into the smallest coherent
system rather than encoded as separate tokens or variants. See the System-first
design section of `AGENTS.md`.

## Code comments

The repository carries **no comments in authored code**, config, styles or
workflows. Rationale lives in the Markdown documentation instead. See the No
comments section of `AGENTS.md` for the governed file set and the rule on
functional suppression directives.

## Current visual status

**Components A — awaiting user visual PASS.** The reference surface at
`?reference=components` composes the real reusable controls and mirrors the
grouping of raster sections 02 and 03.

**Foundations / Colors — visually accepted by the user on 2026-08-19.**

The Foundations reference surface mirrors the raster's five sections so the
colour system can be compared side by side. It is reached at
`?reference=foundations`.

The Footer gradient runs left-to-right, matching the visible raster specimen,
which is horizontal despite the poster's 180 degree annotation. Its stops are
unchanged. The other five gradients were measured against their specimens and
left as they were, since none showed a material mismatch.

Typography and geometry deliberately do not match the raster: it documents no
font family, type scale, spacing or radius scale, so those were not invented.

## Current routes

None. No router is installed.

## Current dependencies

Runtime: `react`, `react-dom`.

Dev: `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript`, `@types/react`,
`@types/react-dom`, `@types/node`, `sass-embedded`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`,
`postcss-pxtorem`, `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `globals`,
`eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`,
`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `prettier`, `stylelint`, `stylelint-config-standard-scss`.

Nothing else is installed. In particular there is no router, no Supabase, no
data-fetching, state, form, schema, mocking, or E2E library.

## Scripts

```
npm run dev           # Vite dev server (user-owned; agents do not start it)
npm run build         # tsc -b && vite build
npm run preview       # preview the production build
npm run typecheck     # tsc -b
npm run lint          # eslint .
npm run lint:styles   # stylelint "src/**/*.scss"
npm run format        # prettier --write .
npm run format:check  # prettier --check .
```

CI runs install → typecheck → lint → lint:styles → format:check → build.

## Deferred Foundations evidence

`Foundations.png` does not specify these categories, so they are outside the
accepted Foundations closure. Nothing was invented to fill the gaps. Each is
deferred until a real raster or a real downstream consumer supplies evidence, and
none of them blocks the closed milestone.

- Typography scale and font assets — no family, weights or type scale evidenced;
  the system font stack stands in.
- Spacing scale.
- Radius scale.
- Shadow / elevation scale.
- Layout primitives.
- Named breakpoints and responsive token decisions — `$breakpoints` stays empty
  and `fluid()` has no consumer.
- Overlay and Backdrop opacity, and what distinguishes the two roles.
- Raster scale factor (1x / 1.5x / 2x), still unconfirmed; it blocks geometry
  work but never affected colour.

## Known deferred work

- ESLint is pinned to the 9.x line. ESLint 10 is current, but
  `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.10.2` and `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.5` declare peer
  support only through ESLint 9. Accessibility coverage was kept rather than
  forced with peer overrides. Revisit when those plugins ship ESLint 10 support.
- TypeScript is pinned to `~6.0.2`. TypeScript 7 is current, but
  `typescript-eslint@8.67` requires `<6.1.0`. Revisit when it supports 7.
- No `public/` directory exists. Add one only when a genuine stable public asset
  is needed.
- No favicon is declared yet.

## Active open questions

None.

## Next approved step

**ChatGPT / user visual review of Components A**, against sections 02 and 03 of
`E:\Work\Frontend\Pictures\GoodCall-references\Components.png`.

Components stays open after that review. Sections 01 and 04-08 each need their
own bounded slice.

## Normative repository docs

- `AGENTS.md` — canonical agent policy (wins on conflict).
- `CLAUDE.md` — entry pointer for Claude Code.
- `README.md` — developer setup and workflow.
- `docs/current-state.md` — this file.
